# MTA_LEDMatrix_display
led matrix display of NYC MTA trains on ESP32.

Uses an Adafruit Matrix Portal S3 board and a 64x64 led matrix display (Version: IS-P2.5-32S-64x64-SMD2020-4x45⁰).

There is a standalone Python script to get the MTA information that I used to get going.

This currently only decodes the NYC MTA A trains going uptown from the 145th St. station.

Intended to let my goofy son know when he has to leave to get to school on time.
